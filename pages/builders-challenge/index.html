        <h3>About the challenge</h3>
        <p>We at Mozilla believe in AI: in its power, its commercial opportunity,
        and its potential to solve the world’s most challenging problems. But we
        also recognize its risks and want to help develop it responsibly to serve
        society. That’s why we’ve created the Responsible AI Challenge, a 1-day
        in-person event to inspire and support a community of Builders working on
        Trustworthy AI products and solutions.</p>

        <p>The event will convene some of the brightest thinkers, technologists,
        ethicists and business leaders for talks, workshops and working sessions
        to help technologists, entrepreneurs and creators get their ideas off the
        ground. Our goal is to identify and bring together entrepreneurs and builders
        who believe in our mission of trustworthy AI and give them resources,
        funding, support and cross-pollination, so they can make better products
        and build more responsible companies.</p>

            or trustworthy design. We encourage projects that have a strong mission and

                <p>Think general purpose internet products and services aimed at a wide
                audience. This includes products and services spanning from social

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Agency</h4>
                <p>Is your AI designed with personal agency in mind? Do people have
                control over how they use the AI, over how their data is used, and
                over the algorithm’s output?</p>

                <h4>Accountability</h4>
                <p>Are you providing transparency into how your AI systems work, are
                you set up to support accountability when things go wrong?</p>

                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <p>How are you collecting, storing and sharing people’s data?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Fairness</h4>
                <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
                    <li>Are your computational models, data, and frameworks reflecting
                    or amplifying existing bias, or assumptions resulting in biased or
                    discriminatory outcomes, or have outsized impact on marginalized
                    communities?</li>
                    <li>Are computing and human labor used to build your AI system
                    vulnerable to exploitation and overwork?</li>
                    <li>Is the climate crisis being accelerated by your AI through
                    energy consumption or speeding up the extraction of natural
                    resources?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Safety</h4>
                <p>Are bad actors able to carry out sophisticated attacks by exploiting
                your AI systems?</p>
